            I studied Game development at Malm√∂ University. During my time there
            I have finished multiple group projects, everything from making
            boardgames to creating digital games. The roles I have taken during
            the projects are gameplay and AI programmer aswell as 3D Character
            animator.
            <br></br>
            After that I was a participant in a fullstack developer program at
            Experis Academy where I deepened my knowledge in front and backend
            development.

            One of my passions aside from coding is to illustrate and animate.
            The thing that I love with art is progression and self improvement,
            which is why I am always looking for opportunities to challange
            myself in order to grow.

            When I am not studying, I am probably working on a personal project,
            drawing or learning new random things.
